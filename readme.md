# Hybrid Quantum-Classical GAN

A hybrid reinforcement learning quantum GAN implementation for generating MNIST-like images.

## Overview
This project implements a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) that combines quantum computing with classical machine learning. The quantum generator produces MNIST-like images while being optimized by reinforcement learning for circuit design. The system demonstrates how quantum circuits can be used for generative tasks, with results showing the characteristic patterns of early-stage quantum ML training.
